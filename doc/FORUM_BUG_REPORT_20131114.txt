Hi,

I have Brain Products data sets (*.eeg, *.vmrk, *.vhdr). I never had problems importing them before as raw files. But now, since I updated, it seems that the functions that opens raw Brainamp files (in_fopen_brainamp.m) set the format (and device) as 'EEG-DELTAMED' (and 'DELTAMED'). I saw this at lines 145 and 147 respectively.

Then when it tries to read the raw file, it calls function "in_fopen_deltamed.m" instead of "in_fopen_brainamp.m" and crashes.

Hope this can be fixed. For now, I will fix it manually for myself. Thanks!
