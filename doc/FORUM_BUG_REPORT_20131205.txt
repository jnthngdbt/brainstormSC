Hi,

I imported a raw file. I tried to import a set of events (some single, some extended) generated in another software (in a supported Brainamp *.vmrk format), but I obtain the following error:

************
Line 97: horzcat Dimensions of matrices being concatenated are not consistent.

The error points to this in process function <process_evt_import.m>:

************
% Report number of detected events
bst_report('Info', sProcess, sInput, sprintf('Added to file: %d events in %d different categories', size([newEvents.times],2), length(newEvents)));
************

I figured out that the faulty expression was "[newEvents.times]"; since the imported events contain single (size(newEvents.times,1)==1) AND extended (size(newEvents.times,1)==2) events, the concatenation here is not valid. To make it worked, I changed "[newEvents.times]" with "[newEvents.epochs]" since (to my knowledge and understanding) "size(newEvents.epochs,1)==1" is always true.

Hope this can help to fix this bug (if there really is a bug).

Besides that, thanks for your wonderful software.
